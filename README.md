csharpkoans
===========

A koan is a puzzle or riddle for a student to think about. The purpose of this project is to provide several puzzles for those learning C#. These puzzles expose some of the behaviors and nuances of the languages that newer users may not be familiar with.

All of the koans are denoted with a KoanAttribute. They will have XML documentation in the form of two or three tags. The tags you will always see are the \<summary\> and \<instructions\> tags. The \<summary\> tag explains the expected behavior and gives purpose to the Koan. The \<instructions\> tag gives instructions on what needs to be done to solve the Koan.
